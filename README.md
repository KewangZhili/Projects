**Papyrus Nebulae-Proj-1:**

**This project was done in GOOGLE COLABORAORY**

**I first used ADOBE PDF Extract API to extract the tables and text with character bounds from each of the test cases**
**Then I unzipped the outputs and read the json file to extract out the text using RegEx in Python and Pandas to create the dataframe**
**I then read the tables from the zip files and then created a cross join (for each test case pdf file ) and went on appending the results to the final ans**

**Finally converted by ans into csv file**

**All the files from the TestDataSet were uploaded to GOOGLE COLABORAORY **ONE AFTER ANOTHER** and saved in /content directory inside it**

**And then I proceeded in the way mentioned in the commments with the code**

**And finally my output was ExtractedData.csv**

**KINDLY RUN THE CODE IN GOOGLE COLAB AND upload the files as mentioned in the code comments and here above**

**I am attaching the final output**
